# double-pendulum-tracker
Application to observe and analyse a double pendulum with a webcam. 


# How does it work?
The program is used to track and analyse the motion of a double pendulum. The double pendulum is decorated with two markers at the end of each pendulum. The colors of the markers should be distinct from each other and not appear somewhere in the background seen by the webcam. The program will use these markers to continuously locate the position and compute the angles of the pendulum.  

# How to use it?
When executing the python file a window will pop up and show the view of the webcam and wait for the user to make three double click in the window. These double clicks tell the program 1. where the axis of the pendulm is, 2. how the first marker looks like and 3. how the second marker looks like.
